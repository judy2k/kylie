Kylie provides mappings between JSON data structures and Python objects. It
provides a reasonable amount of power with only a tiny bit of magic, and it has
100% code coverage.

* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://kylie.readthedocs.org/

It supports name and type-mapping, and it's not bound to JSON, although it is
geared to serializing and de-serializing data to and from JSON-type data
structures such as dicts, lists, strings, numbers, and bools.


Example
-------

::

    class SpanishInquisitionModel(Model):
        inquisition_id = Attribute('id')
        expected = Attribute(python_type=bool, serialized_type=int)

    >>> surprise = SpanishInquisitionModel(inquisition_id=1234, expected=False)
    >>> surprise.inquisition_id
    1234
    >>> surprise.serialize()
    {'id': 1234, expected=0}

Note that the attribute ``inquisition_id`` becomes the dict key ``"id"``, and
expected is mapped to ``0`` instead of ``False``.

We can now take this dict, ``dumps`` it to JSON, and somewhere else call
the following on the json_data (which is a dict returned from ``loads``)::

    >>> my_surprise = SpanishInquisitionModel().deserialize(json_data)
    >>> my_surprise.inquisition_id
    1234
    >>> my_surprise.expected
    False

Kylie also supports nested models, so you can embed other Model instances
inside the data, and Kylie will manage serialization and deserialization of
them for you. See the docs_ for details.

Features
--------

* Allows properties to have different names between Models and python dictionary keys.
* Allows type conversion when serializing and de-serializing objects.
* Automatic serialization/deserialization of attributes that are also Models.
* Not bound to JSON in any way, and should also be useful for MessagePack_

Non-Features
------------

So what doesn't Kylie do yet? Well, there are quite a few things, because it's
very new:

* Can't currently map to lists of nested objects (well, you can, but you have
  write the attribute mapper functions yourself.
* Doesn't have any mechanism for validation. I am planning to add this, once I
  decide the best way to do it. *Ideas welcome!*
* Doesn't have any built-in mechanism for choosing between different types to
  deserialize a dict to. Again, you can do this through customized type mapper
  functions. At the very least, I'll document this soon. I plan to add the
  ability to automatically deserialize to a type based on, for example, a
  ``__type__`` item in the dict.
* No post-serialize or post-deserialize options, unless you do it yourself.
  This would allow wiring up of objects that are referred to by ``id`` and
  provided elsewhere in the serialized data-structure, for example.

So, lots to do! The amount of non-features currently outweighs the list of
features, but I think Kylie is already useful.


Why is it called Kylie?
-----------------------

I named it `especially for you`_. Back in the late 80's (I'm old!) Kylie and
Jason were today's Kim and Kanye. **This** Kylie works well with JSON. Geddit?
